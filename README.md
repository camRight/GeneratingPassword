# Password Script

This program is designed to create a password using math.floor/math.random. Be aware that there is only a certain amount of entropy. Thus be weary using this password generator for anything that requires rock-solid security.

Password Character Length is configurable. One can also enable or disable upperCase, lowerCase, numbers, and symbols.


## Special Characters

special Characters script lines **29-32** listed special characters because certain websites do not allow *ALL* special characters.
Thus I implemented the most universally acceptable characters in a string.
